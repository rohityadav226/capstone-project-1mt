#   Capstone Project (External) - NLP | Sentiment Analysis | 1millionteachers.com

This capstone project aims to gather, examine and present unstructured and imbalanced data from various social media platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp. A web app will be created to provide stakeholders with a user-friendly experience after analyzing collected data using data science techniques.

## Steps Involved :
### Data Collection:
The first step involves scraping data from designated social media platforms and storing the data in a database.

### Data Wrangling:
The collected data will then be consolidated and cleaned to remove any irrelevant or redundant information to ensure data quality.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The next step is to conduct EDA to better understand the data. This involves summarizing the characteristics of the data, identifying outliers and correlations, and checking for missing values.

### Data Pre-processing:
The consolidated and cleaned data will then undergo data pre-processing, which includes normalizing, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and scaling.

### Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques:
The pre-processed data will then be subjected to unsupervised machine learning techniques such as clustering and labeling will be applied to gain insights and group similar data points. The results of this process will then be used to create a supervised machine learning model.

### Data Visualization:
The results will be presented in a visual format to provide clear and easy-to-understand insights into the data.

### Integration into Web Application:
The findings from all the above-mentioned steps will be integrated into a web application, which will provide the functionality to perform all the steps from scratch on fresh data with a few clicks, which will give stakeholders an easy-to-use user interface.

### Tools & Technique Used: 
Python Scripting, MySQL, Graph API, TF-IDF, word2vec, PCA, K-means & Hierarchical clustering, Streamlit, NLTK, Keras, LSTM, Docker.
